# ReaClaw: Technical Decisions

Key architectural decisions and rationale. Read this before modifying the design.

---

## 1. Implementation Type: Native C++ REAPER Extension

**Decision:** ReaClaw is a native REAPER extension (`.dll` / `.dylib` / `.so`), not an external process.

**Rationale:**
- A native extension runs inside REAPER's process and has direct access to the full REAPER C++ SDK via `GetFunc()` — every function REAPER exposes is available.
- No bridge scripts. No scraping REAPER's web interface. No limitations on what can be queried or controlled.
- Script registration via `AddRemoveReaScript()` is a direct API call.
- Action enumeration is two-sourced:
  - **Native built-in actions** come from a **bundled static ID→name table** (`tools/native_actions.tsv` → generated `src/reaper/native_actions.gen.h`, ~4300 entries). REAPER does **not** expose its native actions through any SDK enumeration call — `kbd_getTextFromCmd`/`kbd_enumerateActions` return nothing for them (verified: SWS off → live enumeration yields only ~10 extension actions, zero native). Native command IDs are stable across REAPER versions/platforms, so one bundled table serves all builds.
  - **Extension/script actions** (SWS, ReaPack, ReaScripts, …) are live-enumerated at startup via `kbd_getTextFromCmd()` + `kbd_enumerateActions()`, so the catalog reflects whatever is actually installed.
- REAPER loads the extension automatically at startup from the `UserPlugins` directory.

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- External Go/Python/Rust process calling REAPER's built-in web interface: Limited to what REAPER's HTTP interface exposes. Requires a "bridge" ReaScript workaround. No native script registration. Wrong architecture for this problem.

---

## 2. Language: C++17

**Decision:** C++17 standard.

**Rationale:**
- REAPER itself is C++. The SDK headers and WDL use C++.
- On Windows, MSVC is required because REAPER uses pure virtual interface classes with a specific ABI; other compilers are incompatible on Windows.
- C++17 gives us `std::filesystem`, `std::optional`, `std::string_view`, structured bindings — reduces boilerplate without extra libraries.
- All chosen vendor libraries (cpp-httplib, nlohmann/json) work with C++17.

**Platform compilers:**
- Windows: MSVC (required — ABI compatibility)
- macOS: Clang (Xcode)
- Linux: GCC or Clang

---

## 3. Embedded HTTP/HTTPS Server: cpp-httplib

**Decision:** [cpp-httplib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib)

**Rationale:**
- **Header-only** — a single `httplib.h`. Drop it in `vendor/` and include it. No separate build step.
- **HTTPS via OpenSSL** — same library handles both HTTP and HTTPS; just pass cert/key paths to `SSLServer`.
- **Cross-platform** — works identically on Windows, macOS, Linux.
- **Thread pool** — built-in concurrent request handling.
- **Actively maintained** — 13K+ GitHub stars, production use in many projects.

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- **Boost.Beast:** Requires pulling in all of Boost. Overkill.
- **Crow:** Separate build required; more complexity.
- **Pistache:** Linux-only.

---

## 4. TLS: OpenSSL

**Decision:** OpenSSL for all TLS operations.

**Rationale:**
- cpp-httplib's HTTPS support is built on OpenSSL — shared dependency, no extra library.
- Available on all target platforms via system packages or vcpkg.
- Supports both self-signed (auto-generated on first run) and CA-signed certificates.

**Self-signed cert generation:** Use `EVP_PKEY_keygen` + X509 APIs in C++ at startup if no cert is configured. Stored in `{ResourcePath}/reaclaw/certs/`.

---

## 5. Persistence: SQLite Amalgamation

**Decision:** SQLite, distributed as the official C amalgamation (`sqlite3.c` + `sqlite3.h`).

**Rationale:**
- **Zero infrastructure** — single file database; no server process.
- **Bundled as source** — two files added directly to `vendor/`. No external dependency.
- **ACID** — reliable transactions; safe for concurrent reads.
- **Fast** — catalog lookups, script caching, and execution history are read-heavy, low-volume workloads SQLite handles well.
- **Easy backup** — copy one file.

SQLite is always sufficient for this use case. ReaClaw is a single-machine REAPER extension; there is no multi-server scenario.

---

## 6. JSON: nlohmann/json

**Decision:** [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) (single header `json.hpp`)

**Rationale:**
- Header-only — drop in `vendor/` and include.
- Handles all API request/response serialization and config file parsing.
- Intuitive API: `json["key"] = value`.

**Config format:** JSON, not YAML. nlohmann/json handles it; a YAML parser (yaml-cpp) would require building a separate library.

---

## 7. Build System: CMake

**Decision:** CMake 3.20+

**Rationale:**
- De facto standard for cross-platform C++ projects.
- Supported by all major IDEs (Visual Studio, VS Code, CLion, Xcode).
- Works with MSVC, Clang, and GCC.
- vcpkg integration for OpenSSL via `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`.
- `install` target copies the built extension directly to the REAPER `UserPlugins` directory.

---

## 8. Threading Model: Command Queue

**Decision:** Background server thread pool with a main-thread command queue for non-threadsafe REAPER calls.

**Rationale:**
The REAPER SDK distinguishes threadsafe from non-threadsafe API functions. `Main_OnCommand` (action execution) must be called from REAPER's main thread. Most state reads (`CountTracks`, `GetTrack`, etc.) are threadsafe.

- cpp-httplib runs its thread pool on background threads.
- Threadsafe state reads are made directly from handler threads — zero added latency.
- Non-threadsafe calls are posted to a `std::queue<Command>` protected by `std::mutex`.
- A REAPER timer callback (registered via `plugin_register("timer", ...)`) drains the queue on the main thread at ~30fps.
- Each queued command carries a `std::promise<Result>`; the handler blocks on the `std::future` with a 5s timeout.

**Trade-off:** ~33ms maximum added latency for action execution (one timer tick). Acceptable for this use case.

---

## 9. REAPER API Binding Strategy

**Decision:** Load all needed REAPER API functions at startup via `rec->GetFunc(name)` using `#define REAPERAPI_IMPLEMENT` before including `reaper_plugin_functions.h`.

**Rationale:**
- This is the canonical approach used by SWS and other major REAPER extensions.
- Populates global function pointers for all REAPER API functions in one call (`REAPERAPI_LoadAPI`).
- Log a warning for any pointer that comes back null (indicates older REAPER version missing that API).

**Key functions used:**
- `kbd_enumerateActions`, `SectionFromUniqueID` — catalog
- `Main_OnCommand`, `Main_OnCommandEx` — execution (main thread only)
- `AddRemoveReaScript` — script registration
- `CountTracks`, `GetTrack`, `GetTrackName`, `GetSetMediaTrackInfo` — track state
- `GetProjectTimeSignature2`, `GetCursorPosition`, `GetPlayState` — project state
- `GetResourcePath`, `GetAppVersion`, `ShowConsoleMsg` — utility

---

## 10. Script Validation: Syntax Only

**Decision:** Validate Lua syntax before registration. No static analysis. No approval gate.

**Rationale:**
- The agent submitting a script is a trusted AI system — that's the entire premise of ReaClaw.
- Syntax validation exists to catch generation errors (malformed output, truncated response) before they reach REAPER, not to second-guess the agent's intent.
- Static analysis (warning on `os.execute`, etc.) is noise when the agent put it there intentionally.
- An approval gate defeats automation entirely.

**Implementation:** Shell out to `luac -p {file}` if available; lightweight fallback otherwise. Return error with line number on failure; do not register.

---

## 11. No LLM Client in the Extension

**Decision:** ReaClaw does not call any LLM API. The agent generates scripts; ReaClaw registers them.

**Rationale:**
- The agent calling ReaClaw is already an LLM. Having the extension call an LLM on behalf of an LLM is architectural redundancy.
- Removing the LLM client eliminates: outbound HTTP code, API key management in the extension, provider abstraction (Anthropic/OpenAI/etc.), and the associated config section.
- The correct flow: agent generates Lua → `POST /scripts/register` → ReaClaw validates syntax and calls `AddRemoveReaScript`.

---

## 12. Authentication: Two Modes Only

**Decision:** `none` or `api_key`. No mTLS.

**Rationale:**
- ReaClaw runs on the same machine as REAPER. The realistic auth scenarios are:
  - `none`: localhost-only access, trusted environment
  - `api_key`: home network or any case where a simple shared secret is sufficient
- mTLS (client certificates, CA setup) is never going to be used for a personal REAPER extension. It adds certificate management complexity with no practical benefit.

---

## 13. No Rate Limiting

**Decision:** No rate limiting.

**Rationale:**
- ReaClaw is a single-user tool. One person and their AI agent use it.
- Rate limiting defends against external attackers abusing the API. If attackers can reach your REAPER extension's port, rate limiting is not the right defense — network isolation is.
- Removing it eliminates middleware code, per-IP sliding window tracking, and config options.

---

## 14. Plugin Naming and Location

**Decision:** Plugin named `reaper_reaclaw` with platform-appropriate extension.

**Rationale:** REAPER extensions conventionally use the `reaper_` prefix (e.g., `reaper_mp3`, `reaper_sws`), signaling to REAPER that this is an extension rather than a VST/CLAP plugin.

**Output files:**
- Windows: `reaper_reaclaw.dll`
- macOS: `reaper_reaclaw.dylib`
- Linux: `reaper_reaclaw.so`

**Install path:**
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\REAPER\UserPlugins\`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/REAPER/UserPlugins/`
- Linux: `~/.config/REAPER/UserPlugins/`

---

## 15. Config Location

**Decision:** `{GetResourcePath()}/reaclaw/config.json`

**Rationale:** `GetResourcePath()` returns the user's REAPER config directory on all platforms. Storing ReaClaw's config there keeps everything alongside other REAPER configs. ReaClaw creates the `reaclaw/` subdirectory and writes defaults if the file is missing.

---

## 16. API Coverage: Tiered

**Decision:** ReaClaw offers **tiered** coverage of REAPER, not a single uniform layer:

1. **Structured verbs** for the objects agents touch constantly — tracks
   (create/delete; writable name, color, folder depth, vol, pan, mute, solo,
   arm), track FX (add by name, enable, parameter get/set, delete), routing
   (sends add/delete + readable in `/state/tracks`), and selection.
2. **Action-runner** (`/execute/action`, `/execute/sequence`) over the full
   bundled + installed action catalog (`/catalog/search`) for the long tail.
3. **Lua escape hatch** (`/scripts/register`) for anything not exposed as a verb
   or action.

`GET /capabilities` advertises which tier covers what, so an agent can tell at a
glance what is directly supported vs. what needs an action or a script.

**Rationale:** A real session (the 36-track friction log, #9) showed that the
five-field track write was far too thin — naming, FX insertion, folders, color,
and routing all had to be coerced out of parameterless action IDs or hand-written
Lua, costing 146 calls and many dead ends. Mirroring the entire ~865-function
SDK as REST is the opposite mistake: a large, low-value maintenance surface.
Tiered coverage targets the common 20% with typed verbs while keeping the action
and Lua layers for everything else. Settled with Dave on 2026-06-20 (resolves the
open question in issue #7). See `ReaClaw_IDEAS.md` and the Phase 4 checklist.

**Graduated to verbs (Epic #16, v1.3.0):** markers/regions, tempo/time-signature
map (read + add) with beat↔time utilities, and envelope point writes now have
structured endpoints — the API-surface analysis (`ReaClaw_REAPER_API_ANALYSIS.md`
Part 4) and real usage showed these are session primitives reached for constantly,
so the cost of a thin verb is justified. Epic #16 also added undo grouping (every
mutation is now a single undoable step), FX presets + real-unit param metadata,
send extended props (mute/phase/mono/mode), project extras (dirty/length/notes),
and a MIDI-editor catalog section.

**Graduated to verbs (Epic #17, v1.4.0):** media items/takes/sources. Items moved
from read-only to full CRUD (create/move/split/trim/delete, position/length/fade/
vol/mute writes), with take properties (vol/pan/pitch/playrate/preserve-pitch) and
source metadata (file/type/length/sample-rate/channels) on reads. Also graduated:
track extras (phase, channel count, pan mode + dual-pan, rec input, MIDI hw out,
parent send), FX copy-to-track and online/offline, item selection write, and a
persistent per-project ext-state scratchpad (`/project/extstate`). Justified the
same way as Epic #16 — these are the objects *inside* a track that a real arranging
session manipulates constantly, so a thin typed verb beats coercing them out of Lua.

**Tier-C deferred within Epic #17 (still reach via action or script):** take FX
chains (`TakeFX_*`), MIDI note/event CRUD (Lua already covers it well), and
multi-project support. Lower frequency / higher complexity; the Lua escape hatch
is the right layer for now.

**Still not in scope as verbs (reach via action or script):** MIDI events,
render/freeze, project open/save. These may graduate later if usage warrants.

---

## 17. Audio Perception: built-in, exact-where-possible, tagged (Epic #18)

**Decision:** ReaClaw analyses audio **in-process**, built-in and always
available (no external tool), and **tags every measure** with a `method` and
`confidence` so the agent trusts each number appropriately:

- **Loudness / level — exact.** LUFS-I, RMS-I, peak, and true-peak come from
  REAPER's own offline analyser (`CalculateNormalization`, full decode). Tagged
  `offline_analysis`, confidence 1.0. Clipping is `derived` from true-peak.
- **Spectral balance — estimated.** A rough low/mid/high band-energy digest +
  spectral centroid, computed by decoding samples (`PCM_source::GetSamples`)
  through a small in-tree FFT. Tagged `estimated_dsp`, confidence 0.6 — a digest,
  not a calibrated analyzer.
- **Metering — introspection.** `/state/meters` reads REAPER's live meters
  (`Track_GetPeakInfo`/`Track_GetPeakHoldDB`); only meaningful while audio runs.

**Consequence vs. observation (from IDEAS).** Analysis endpoints are *independent
observations* the agent asks for. **Hints** are the *consequence of a specific
edit* and ride inline on that edit's mutating response (`hints[]`) — a small
hand-authored invariant set, distinct from (though sharing a channel with) the
future learned suggestions of Epic #5.

**Rationale:** "Most REAPER bridges are blind command pipes." The cheap, exact
loudness path already existed in the SDK, so it would be perverse to estimate it;
spectral has no built-in primitive, so a tagged estimate is the honest answer.
Token economy (IDEAS): prefer a number/digest over an image, targeted over total,
heavier feedback opt-in (`measures=` filter, `start`/`end` windowing).

**Open questions (carried, deliberately unresolved):**
- **DSP locus.** Analysis runs on the main thread (SDK safety) inside a 30 s
  budget; a long source can freeze the UI briefly or `408`. A dedicated
  out-of-process analyzer would fix both at a footprint/complexity cost — revisit
  if long-render analysis becomes common.
- **Onset / density** detection is deferred (transient analysis is higher
  complexity and outside #18's acceptance criteria).

**Visual perception & probes (Epic #19) — graduations:**
- **Pitch & key are built-in, not gated.** The 2026-06-20 "advanced optional"
  decision assumed musical attributes needed an external tool. In practice pitch
  (FFT dominant-fundamental) and key (chromagram + Krumhansl–Schmuckler) fall out
  of the *same decode + FFT* the spectral digest already uses, so they ship
  built-in as `estimated_dsp`. The optional external tool stays the path for
  detection that genuinely needs more — **tempo-from-audio** (`bpm-tools`'
  `bpm-tag`), which is `available:false` when absent. Tempo also has an exact
  `introspection` source: the project tempo at the item's position.
  - *Pitch caveat:* a harmonic product spectrum was tried first but collapses on
    pure tones (no 2f/3f energy → a subharmonic whose 3rd harmonic hits the peak
    wins). Reverted to plain peak-picking + a guarded sub-octave correction.
- **A probe is a flavour of the analysis surface, not a registry.** The open
  question ("first-class probe vs. action machinery") is resolved pragmatically:
  probes are a `/analysis/.../probe` sub-resource returning tagged data. A
  registerable, user-authored probe *library* (the "compounding" aspiration) is
  deferred until there's demand — building the registry now would be speculative.
- **A/B visual diff is deferred to the shared snapshot/state-diff layer.** Both
  Epic #19's A/B diff and Epic #20's correction-mining need session snapshots over
  time; that layer is built once and shared (ROADMAP §4), so the diff lands with
  it rather than inside #19. #19 ships visualization, screenshot ergonomics, and
  probes; the diff is the one carried sliver.

---

## 18. Learned Suggestions & the Snapshot Layer (Epic #20)

**Decision:** ReaClaw learns from its own use — locally, opt-in, never phoning
home — and the learning is built on a **shared snapshot / state-diff layer** that
also retro-unlocks the #19 A/B diff.

- **Snapshot / state-diff layer (the cross-cutting prep).** A canonical,
  diff-stable JSON slice of project state is captured on the main thread, stored
  in `state_snapshots`, and diffed by a pure header-only recursive differ
  (`util/jsondiff.h`) into `[{path, op, from, to}]`. Built once, shared by #20's
  correction mining and #19's A/B visual diff. The snapshot is a *focused* slice
  (not the full `/state` payload) so diffs stay legible and stable across reads.
- **Learning model — pairwise association, not ML.** Each structured edit is an
  event; transitions (antecedent → consequent) by the same agent within a window
  accumulate counts; `confidence = P(consequent | antecedent)`, gated by
  `min_support` + `min_confidence`. This is a transparent, inspectable
  association-rule layer — no model files, no opaque weights. Heavier mining
  (multi-step, value-aware "corrected *to* Y") is deferred until the simple layer
  proves its worth; the acceptance criteria only need pairwise.
- **Local-first & opt-in are non-negotiable (from IDEAS Q8).** Off by default
  (`learning.enabled=false`); while off, `note()` is a no-op and nothing is
  recorded. All state is in the same local SQLite DB — there is **no network
  egress anywhere in the extension** (settled in §11: no LLM client, no outbound
  calls), so "nothing leaves the machine" is structural, not a promise.
- **Shared channel, distinct source.** Learned suggestions ride the same
  suggestion idea as #18's hints but are tagged `method:"learned"` (vs. the
  hand-authored invariants), so an agent can weight them differently. They are
  **advisory, never automatic** — ReaClaw suggests, the agent decides.

**Open / deferred:** value-aware corrections and multi-step workflow mining;
richer edit coverage (every mutating verb emits an event — currently the
high-traffic track/FX/send/item set); surfacing learned suggestions inline on
mutations (today they are a pull via `/suggestions`).

---

## 19. Programmatic Production: Offline-First Render Engine (Epic #32)

**Decision (direction; PoC proven 2026-06-24, not yet built as first-class verbs):**
ReaClaw is, beside control and perception, a **headless audio-production backend** —
a `composition spec → mastered file` function — and that production path is
**offline-first**.

- **Offline, not realtime.** Render is decoupled from the audio clock and runs
  faster than real time. A 7-track API-built composition rendered offline to a
  24-bit/44.1k WAV in 0.36 s for 8 s of audio (~20×+) on the headless Pi rig. The
  headless host needs **no GPU and no audio hardware** — audio device = *Dummy*;
  REAPER only needs an X server (e.g. Xvfb) to host the GUI process. The realtime
  path (PulseAudio null sink + `x11grab`) exists **only** for producing a *video* /
  for live human observation, and is incidental to production. (See `demos/`.)
- **Already works via the escape hatch; the epic makes it first-class.** Today
  rendering is driven by Lua (`GetSetProjectInfo_String` RENDER_* + action
  `41824`). The fiddly part is `RENDER_FORMAT` — REAPER encodes the codec as a
  base64 blob. A first-class `/render` verb MUST hide that behind named params
  (`{format, srate, bit_depth, channels, bounds, output, normalize?}`); callers
  never construct the blob. This is consistent with §16 (tiered coverage:
  structured verbs over the escape hatch for common operations).
- **Same trust + locality model.** Render/save/open inherit the existing stance —
  the agent is trusted (§10, no approval gate), and there is **no network egress**
  (§11), so a production pipeline stays local by construction. Output paths are
  caller-specified files on the local box; uploading anywhere is an explicit,
  separate step (e.g. the `gdrive` skill), never implicit in a render.
- **Long renders are jobs, not blocking calls.** A long project or a batch can
  exceed an HTTP timeout and would otherwise hold REAPER's main-thread command
  queue (§8); the render-job model (#35) returns a handle + pollable status. This
  is the settled answer to the long-standing "long-render UX" open question.

**Open / deferred:** the concrete `/render`, project save/load/open, and async-job
API contracts are designed when Epic #32 is picked up (children #33–#36); multi-
project handling for `/project/open` touches the deferred Tier-C area (§16).

---

## 20. Dependency Policy: Deliberate & Tiered (issue #37)

ReaClaw stays deliberately thin: vendored core libraries only, a Lua escape hatch for the
long tail, and **no runtime dependency** on REAPER-side extensions. SWS was used *transiently*
to generate the native-action table (`tools/`) and is never shipped or required. Before leaning
on anything external we apply a deliberate policy, not ad-hoc decisions.

**Four kinds of dependency, not equal:**
1. **Vendored / build-time libs** linked into the `.so` (cpp-httplib, SQLite, OpenSSL,
   nlohmann/json) — ship inside us.
2. **Optional REAPER-side extensions** (SWS, ReaPack) — live in the user's REAPER, called via
   the SDK/Lua; we ship nothing but must feature-detect.
3. **Optional external tools/processes** (ffmpeg, a key/tempo analyzer) — user-installed,
   path-configured, skipped when absent.
4. **Network / cloud services** — **forbidden** (local-first; no phoning home; no LLM client, §11).

**Tiered rule:**
- **Tier 0 — Core (required, vendored):** the minimum to *be* ReaClaw. Pinned, license-cleared, in-tree.
- **Tier 1 — Always-on built-ins:** Tier 0 only, no external dep.
- **Tier 2 — Enhanced via optional REAPER extensions (e.g. SWS):** feature-detected
  (`CF_GetSWSVersion`), graceful fallback, **never required**. `/config/reaper` (#44) is the
  reference Tier-2 case.
- **Tier 3 — Enhanced via optional external tools:** opt-in, configured, skipped when absent.
- **Hard rule:** the core path must never require anything above Tier 0.

**Decision checklist for any new dependency:** necessity · optionality (core stays clean?) ·
**license compatibility** (SWS is GPL — calling its runtime-registered API differs legally from
linking it) · feature-detection + graceful degradation · cross-platform incl. aarch64 ·
version-drift handling · CI reproducibility (Linux k3s runners) · maintenance/abandonment risk ·
security surface (per `SECURITY.md`). Feature-detection is *reported* via `/capabilities` (#46)
so agents branch instead of probe-and-fail. Reference research: `docs/research/SWS_DEEP_DIVE.md`.

## 21. API Stability & Versioning Policy (issue #37)

ReaClaw follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/). This section makes the contract explicit.

- **PATCH (x.y.Z):** bug fixes, doc/internal changes; no API surface change.
- **MINOR (x.Y.0):** **additive** API changes — new endpoints, new optional request fields, new
  response fields, new `/capabilities` entries. Additive changes are *backward compatible* and
  are how ReaClaw grows; v1.3→v1.7 added large surface this way, and the full-coverage
  expansion (epic #45) continues to land as MINOR bumps.
- **MAJOR (X.0.0):** **breaking** changes only — removing/renaming an endpoint or field,
  changing a response shape or an error contract, or tightening validation in a
  backward-incompatible way.

**What "stable" means:** any endpoint documented in `docs/API.md` and advertised in
`GET /capabilities` is stable — it will not break except in a MAJOR release, with deprecation
notice first (see below). The Lua escape hatch (`/scripts/register`) and raw action IDs
(`/execute/action`) are inherently version-coupled to REAPER itself and carry no stability
guarantee beyond "the call is accepted."

**Deprecation:** before a breaking change, the old form is marked deprecated in `docs/API.md`
and (where practical) flagged via a `hints[]` entry on the response for at least one MINOR
release before removal in the next MAJOR.

**No 2.0 for additive growth.** Aggressively expanding coverage does **not** justify a major
bump — additive surface is correct as MINOR. A 2.0.0 is reserved for the day we choose to make
the cohesion fixes catalogued in `ReaClaw_COVERAGE_REPORT.md` §6.4 (response-envelope
normalization, relative/absolute icon symmetry, unified error/hints shapes).
